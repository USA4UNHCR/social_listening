# Social Listening Project

The goal is to give the USA for UNHCR's Communications Team and the USA for UNHCR's Fundraising Teams a better understanding of current conversation about refugees and refugee issues in social and popular media. More than 5 million tweets are in a MongoDB (we will provide access) and there will be some smaller files in .csv format for targeted analysis. We share news articles both parsed html and raw html for analysis.
