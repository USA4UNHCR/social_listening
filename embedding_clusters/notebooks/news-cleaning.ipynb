      "<p data-elm-loc=\"1\">Eric Reid appeared to be one of the most reliable defensive backs on this year’s NFL free agent market, at least on paper. But he’s still looking for a job, and his continued unemployment has prompted a second grievance filed against the NFL. The NFL Players Association filed a noninjury grievance related to Reid’s free agency Monday, the union said in a statement.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"2\">It marks the union’s most formal defense yet for players who have protested racial injustice and police brutality during the playing of the national anthem. The grievance is related to questions the safety has been asked about his plans to continue kneeling during the anthem next season.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"3\">“According to our information, a club appears to have based its decision not to sign a player based on the player’s statement that he would challenge the implementation of a club’s policy prohibiting demonstration, which is contrary to League policy,” the NFLPA said in a statement.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"4\">The grievance is connected to Reid’s only known free agency visit this offseason, when <a href=\"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/columnists/paul-daugherty/2018/04/14/paul-daugherty-cincinnati-bengals-passing-eric-reid-not-personal-strictly-business/517782002/\">the Cincinnati Bengals reportedly asked him last month whether he intended to continue protesting</a>, according to a person familiar with the filing. While the Bengals might have made clear that <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/eric-reids-bengals-visit-reveals-hardline-nfl-owners-treating-protests-020636216.html\">they expect all of their players to stand</a> for the anthem, the union’s grievance says teams are operating outside of league rules, which do not require players to stand.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"5\">“We believe these questions are improper, given League policy,” the NFLPA said in its statement.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"6\">A spokesman for the Bengals declined to comment on the grievance.</p>\n",
      "<p class=\"interstitial-link \" data-elm-loc=\"7\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/05/02/eric-reid-charges-nfl-owners-with-collusion-in-grievance/?utm_term=.cad22f9add65\">Eric Reid charges NFL owners with collusion in grievance</a>]</i></p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"8\">In addition, the NFLPA filed a system arbitration case on behalf of all players, which aims to stop clubs from asking any player whether he intends to protest during the national anthem.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"9\">Reid had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/05/02/eric-reid-charges-nfl-owners-with-collusion-in-grievance/\">filed his own grievance Wednesday</a>, charging owners with colluding to keep him out of the league. Reid has been among the most prominent players to protest by taking a knee during the national anthem. He’s said from the earliest days of free agency, which began in March, that teams won’t sign him because of his social activism, even though he’s said he’s willing to stand during the anthem next season.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"10\">Both grievances are now subject to a confidential arbitration process under terms of the collective bargaining agreement between NFL owners and the players’ union.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"11\">The NFLPA was not a formal party to Reid’s initial complaint, but has been supportive of the player’s decision, according to a person familiar with the situation, offering legal counsel and resources. “Our union supports Eric and we are considering other legal options to pursue,” a spokesman said in a statement last week.</p>\n",
      "<p class=\"interstitial-link \" data-elm-loc=\"12\"><i>[<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/05/04/nfl-could-leave-national-anthem-policy-to-individual-teams/?utm_term=.6ab289bca1f2\">NFL owners could leave national anthem policy to individual teams</a>]</i></p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"13\">Reid was the second player to charge the NFL owners with collusion over the anthem protests, and he’s using the same legal team as quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who remained unsigned all of last season.</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"14\">“Colin and Eric have taken courageous action at the expense of their professional careers and personal lives,” their attorneys, Mark Geragos and Ben Meiselas, said in a statement Monday. “They did these selfless acts because they wanted to shine light on inequity and oppression. Today they welcome all NFL Players who have joined in the prosecution of the NFL for their conspiracy and illegal acts. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the NFLPA in our fight for justice, equality and inalienable rights of all Americans.”</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"15\">Even without Kaepernick in the league, Reid continued the protests last year, repeatedly explaining that his protest targeted “systemic oppression.”</p>\n",
      "<p data-elm-loc=\"16\">Reid, 26, was a first-round draft pick by the San Francisco 49ers in 2013, made the Pro Bowl that year and has tallied 10 career interceptions in five seasons.</p>\n",

       "'Perspective  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events The vigor that newly installed Office of Personnel Management Director Jeff Pon has for civil service reform makes the Trump administration’s lack of enthusiasm for federal workplace diversity and inclusion all the more stark. “We want to be bold and aggressive, and we want to make sure that not only is it good for America but it’s also good for our civil service,” Pon said about civil service reform in a monologue to reporters Tuesday. It was a monologue because reporters were not allowed to ask questions during the conference call or follow up on the questions they submitted in advance, the bulk of which Pon didn’t answer. There’s nothing wrong with being a stenographer in a courtroom, but Pon’s refusal to take questions left journalists in the role of glorified dictation takers. Talk of overhauling the federal civil service has been around for decades, with outside experts offering well-considered studies and suggestions. No matter how needed aspects of reform might be, given the hiring freeze Trump implemented shortly after taking office, the pay freeze and compensation cuts the administration has proposed, and repeated Republican attempts to fire feds faster, federal employees can be excused if they view this administration’s push for civil service reform with trepidation. [Mulvaney defends pay freeze even for feds he knows are underpaid] Yet Pon is determined to have a proposal done by the midterm elections, an ambitious goal even if everyone agreed, which is hardly the case. Unfortunately, the passion he has for changing the way federal employees are managed — hired, compensated, promoted, fired and retired — far exceeds the administration’s diluted desire to have the workforce look like the public it serves. That was demonstrated by the two most recent OPM strategic plans — one from the Obama administration and the latest issued by the OPM in February, shortly before Pon took office. They could hardly differ more regarding diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce. The 2014-2018 Strategic Plan issued by the Obama administration makes diversity and inclusion a high priority. For example, the first of five strategic goals under the Obama plan is “attract and engage a diverse and effective OPM workforce.” The Trump plan for 2018-2022 scarcely mentions diversity and inclusion, providing only lip service. Look at the “Summary of Goals and Objectives” on Page 8 of the Trump document. It lists four goals with no mention of diversity and inclusion. In flow-chart fashion, the goals are supported by 14 objectives. None mentions diversity or inclusion. The words “diverse” or “diversity” are mentioned only four times in the 22-page document, compared with 20 times in the Obama administration’s 33 pages. “We find this strategy of omission alarming,” said Wanda V. Killingsworth, president of Federally Employed Women, “and hope that as positions are being filled in the federal government — particularly high-ranking offices — the Trump administration will place emphasis on diversity and inclusion.” While the administration’s retreat from diversity as a top priority can’t be pinned on Pon, he seems happy to represent an administration that gives diversity and inclusion advocates good reason to shudder. He did not respond to questions for this column, but in response to Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) during his October nomination hearing, Pon said he had not read Obama’s Executive Order 13583, “Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce.” In written responses submitted after the hearing, Pon told Harris that agencies “should actively recruit from all segments of society and provide broad leadership development opportunities to build their pipelines for future leaders” and promised “to build upon the goals identified” in Obama’s order. “It is my understanding, based on the last data OPM posted to its website, that minorities as a whole are no longer under-represented across the Federal workforce,” his written response said, “although their representation lags somewhat in SES positions.” “Somewhat” is an understatement for women, who are 35.3 percent of the Senior Executive Service. On the surface, it seems the data belie his understanding. The federal workforce was 8.4 percent Hispanic, according to the OPM’s Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program report for fiscal 2014, which was the document available in October. The fiscal 2016 report issued this February shows a slight increase, to 8.6 percent. In both fiscal years, the percentage of Hispanics in the civilian labor force was about 15 percent, making it seem that they are vastly underrepresented. On this point, however, Pon was not far off. The civilian labor force includes noncitizens. But citizenship is required for most federal jobs. Hispanic citizens are only about 10 percent of the civilian labor force, meaning their representation in the federal workforce is low, but not as low as it initially appears. Nonetheless, the lack of energy for diversity exhibited by the Trump administration worries proponents. “It is troubling that there appears to be a de-emphasis on diversity and inclusion under the Trump administration,” said Gilbert Sandate, chair of the Coalition for Fairness for Hispanics in Government, by email. “As the agency responsible for spearheading the federal government’s D&I policies and programs, it shows an absence of strong leadership and investment in this important area. We urge Director Pon to reevaluate OPM’s strategic direction regarding diversity and inclusion, or lack thereof, and amend this important policy document to ensure that D&I remains a strong component in the federal government’s toolbox.” Read more: Trump administration plans major overhaul of civil service system, but no specifics yet Latest federal diversity report from OPM shows little or no progress and some regression'"

      "<p>Chip and Joanna Gaines said their goodbyes to 'Fixer Upper' during the hit HGTV show's final episode, thanking viewers for their support and even reminiscing about Chip and Joanna's first date, which included a magnolia tree.</p>\n",
      "<p>Last week, an opinion writer caused a bit of a stir by insisting that Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna Gaines</a>, of HGTV’s “Fixer Upper” fame, are frauds who lie about putting their family first. It’s a strange assertion made by someone who has never met the Gaineses, but he decided anyway that the wildly accomplished couple can’t put family first specifically because of their business success.</p>\n",
      "<p>Hogwash.</p>\n",
      "<p>Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna Gaines</a> are a couple made famous not just because of their television show, but because of the admiration and inspiration they elicit for who they are and how they handle their lives.</p>\n",
      "<p>For all the home-improvement shows on television, while the genre itself is fun to watch, what makes a show really work is the people featured in the program. Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a> broke out of the pack because of their attitude and, specifically, their commitment to family. Americans from all walks of life pursue an American dream that often involves running their own business, having a strong marriage and having the freedom to build a family.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Gaineses have done this, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Daryl Austin</a>, identified in his USA Today opinion piece as “a writer and small business owner from Orem, Utah,” has decided their commitment to family is a “talking point” and insists “Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna Gaines</a> did not get where they are by putting their family first.”</p>\n",
      "<p>He mocked their interviews discussing the importance of their family and then continued to insist they’re frauds. He wrote: “Chip told Savannah Guthrie on NBC’s Today show that ‘the most important thing in the world’ for them is their relationship, ‘followed very quickly by these four beautiful kids.’ <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a> told People that ‘family is the most important thing in the world.’ Except it isn’t so. Not if actions really do speak louder than words …”</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a> listed their impressive business ventures and then oddly complained, “They don’t want to be seen simply as a couple that can do it all. They want to be seen as a couple that can do it all while at the same time making their family their top priority. This is just not possible and it does a disservice to the parents who really are putting their children first.”</p>\n",
      "<p>What a shame <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a> felt the need to condemn them publicly in this way. Unless this has nothing to do with Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a>, and more to do with <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a>’s choices in life.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here’s what we do know: People are different. We have different backgrounds, educations, experiences and dreams. The American dream is not one specific thing — it’s the freedom to be able to pursue what best suits you, and it will be different for everyone.</p>\n",
      "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a>’s critique hit, Chip Gaines responded on Twitter making it quite clear he was not going to let the attack on his family slide:</p>\n",
      "<p>“I don’t know <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Daryl</a>, &amp; he clearly doesn’t know me. But for the record: If there is ever a need w/ my family (1st), I’ll shut this circus down so fast it will make your head spin. BUT Jo &amp; I believe, w/ God anything is possible. Including having an amazing family AND career you love.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Indeed. While it’s something many of us aspire to, it’s not easy to achieve. For the Gaineses, family and faith make all things possible.</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a>’s attack struck me as not just on them as a couple, but on <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a> in particular. She is emerging as the star of the family with the new HGTV show focusing on her design talent, and she has a new cookbook, among other ventures. She is a consummate businesswoman who has found the balance to achieve her dreams, which includes being a great mom.</p>\n",
      "<p>She doesn’t do this on her own — she has a support system, including a devoted husband, parents and siblings, plus a staff. Now, with another baby on the way, she is living her American dream, and in the process, making so many things possible for her community and everyone around her.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Gaines empire is led by a woman in partnership with her husband. Their experience, which they share with the American people, provides a unique and important perspective about the power of American entrepreneurship and how our life experiences prepare us for success both in business and on the home-front.</p>\n",
      "<p>In his essay questioning the Gaines’ character, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a> eventually admitted to the choices he and his wife have made as they run their home-based business. He confessed, “My wife and I have owned our business for nearly eight years now. We have deliberately kept it small because we have never wanted it to have a monopoly on our time, and we run it from home so we can be present at all times for our three children. …”</p>\n",
      "<p>That’s nice, as they were free to design a life and business plan that best suited them, and there are significant differences between his family and the Gaines family. One thing is for sure: <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a> will never experience Chip or <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a> writing an article in a national newspaper impugning his character or commitment to his family because he and his wife have made choices different from theirs.</p>\n",

      "President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Iran deal on Tuesday, keeping his campaign promise to end the agreement reached by former President Barack Obama.\n",
      "“This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” Trump said. “It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.”\n",
      "The president announced his decision in a speech at the White House in the Diplomatic Room as Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Vice President Mike Pence looked on.\n",
      "Trump signed a memorandum to end the deal, reinstating the nuclear sanctions against Iran originally put in place by the Obama administration.\n",
      "“America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail,” he said.\n",
      "Trump’s decision signals a major blow to the Obama administration’s signature foreign diplomatic agreement reached in 2015 with the rogue regime.\n",
      "He described the deal as “decaying and rotten” and “defective at its core” recalling it as a “great embarrassment” to all American citizens when it was signed.\n",
      "“A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time,” Trump said. “But it wasn’t.”\n",
      "He denounced the Obama administration for sending billions of dollars to a “regime of great terror” including vast sums of cash. He denounced Iran for using that money to further sponsor terrorism and violence in the Middle East, pointing out that the regimes military budget had grown 40 percent since the deal was reached.\n",
      "“At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction: That a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program,” he said. “Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.”\n",
      "Trump repeatedly trashed the deal during his campaign for president, describing it as a terrible deal that should have never been enacted. At the White House on Tuesday, he said he was determined to keep his promise made to the American people.\n",
      "“Today’s action sends a critical message,” Trump said. “The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them.”\n",
      "Key allies in Europe face their own decision of what to do with the deal whether or not to keep the elements of the deal intact with Iran, choose to reimpose sanctions, or allow it to die.\n",

      "<p>Chip and Joanna Gaines said their goodbyes to 'Fixer Upper' during the hit HGTV show's final episode, thanking viewers for their support and even reminiscing about Chip and Joanna's first date, which included a magnolia tree.</p>\n",
      "<p>Last week, an opinion writer caused a bit of a stir by insisting that Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna Gaines</a>, of HGTV’s “Fixer Upper” fame, are frauds who lie about putting their family first. It’s a strange assertion made by someone who has never met the Gaineses, but he decided anyway that the wildly accomplished couple can’t put family first specifically because of their business success.</p>\n",
      "<p>Hogwash.</p>\n",
      "<p>Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna Gaines</a> are a couple made famous not just because of their television show, but because of the admiration and inspiration they elicit for who they are and how they handle their lives.</p>\n",
      "<p>For all the home-improvement shows on television, while the genre itself is fun to watch, what makes a show really work is the people featured in the program. Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a> broke out of the pack because of their attitude and, specifically, their commitment to family. Americans from all walks of life pursue an American dream that often involves running their own business, having a strong marriage and having the freedom to build a family.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Gaineses have done this, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Daryl Austin</a>, identified in his USA Today opinion piece as “a writer and small business owner from Orem, Utah,” has decided their commitment to family is a “talking point” and insists “Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna Gaines</a> did not get where they are by putting their family first.”</p>\n",
      "<p>He mocked their interviews discussing the importance of their family and then continued to insist they’re frauds. He wrote: “Chip told Savannah Guthrie on NBC’s Today show that ‘the most important thing in the world’ for them is their relationship, ‘followed very quickly by these four beautiful kids.’ <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a> told People that ‘family is the most important thing in the world.’ Except it isn’t so. Not if actions really do speak louder than words …”</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a> listed their impressive business ventures and then oddly complained, “They don’t want to be seen simply as a couple that can do it all. They want to be seen as a couple that can do it all while at the same time making their family their top priority. This is just not possible and it does a disservice to the parents who really are putting their children first.”</p>\n",
      "<p>What a shame <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a> felt the need to condemn them publicly in this way. Unless this has nothing to do with Chip and <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a>, and more to do with <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a>’s choices in life.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here’s what we do know: People are different. We have different backgrounds, educations, experiences and dreams. The American dream is not one specific thing — it’s the freedom to be able to pursue what best suits you, and it will be different for everyone.</p>\n",
      "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a>’s critique hit, Chip Gaines responded on Twitter making it quite clear he was not going to let the attack on his family slide:</p>\n",
      "<p>“I don’t know <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Daryl</a>, &amp; he clearly doesn’t know me. But for the record: If there is ever a need w/ my family (1st), I’ll shut this circus down so fast it will make your head spin. BUT Jo &amp; I believe, w/ God anything is possible. Including having an amazing family AND career you love.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Indeed. While it’s something many of us aspire to, it’s not easy to achieve. For the Gaineses, family and faith make all things possible.</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a>’s attack struck me as not just on them as a couple, but on <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a> in particular. She is emerging as the star of the family with the new HGTV show focusing on her design talent, and she has a new cookbook, among other ventures. She is a consummate businesswoman who has found the balance to achieve her dreams, which includes being a great mom.</p>\n",
      "<p>She doesn’t do this on her own — she has a support system, including a devoted husband, parents and siblings, plus a staff. Now, with another baby on the way, she is living her American dream, and in the process, making so many things possible for her community and everyone around her.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Gaines empire is led by a woman in partnership with her husband. Their experience, which they share with the American people, provides a unique and important perspective about the power of American entrepreneurship and how our life experiences prepare us for success both in business and on the home-front.</p>\n",
      "<p>In his essay questioning the Gaines’ character, <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a> eventually admitted to the choices he and his wife have made as they run their home-based business. He confessed, “My wife and I have owned our business for nearly eight years now. We have deliberately kept it small because we have never wanted it to have a monopoly on our time, and we run it from home so we can be present at all times for our three children. …”</p>\n",
      "<p>That’s nice, as they were free to design a life and business plan that best suited them, and there are significant differences between his family and the Gaines family. One thing is for sure: <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/daryl-austin/\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Austin</a> will never experience Chip or <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/joanna-gaines/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanna</a> writing an article in a national newspaper impugning his character or commitment to his family because he and his wife have made choices different from theirs.</p>\n",
