       "array(['Eric Reid appeared to be one of the most reliable defensive backs on this year’s NFL free agent market, at least on paper. But he’s still looking for a job, and his continued unemployment has prompted a second grievance filed against the NFL. The NFL Players Association filed a noninjury grievance related to Reid’s free agency Monday, the union said in a statement. It marks the union’s most formal defense yet for players who have protested\\xa0racial injustice and police brutality during the playing of the national anthem. The grievance is related to questions the safety has been asked about his plans to continue kneeling during the anthem next season. “According to our information, a club appears to have based its decision not to sign a player based on the player’s statement that he would challenge the implementation of a club’s policy prohibiting demonstration, which is contrary to League policy,” the NFLPA said in a statement. The grievance is connected to Reid’s only known free agency visit this offseason, when the Cincinnati Bengals reportedly asked him last month whether he intended to continue protesting, according to a person familiar with the filing. While the Bengals might have made clear that they expect all of their players to stand for the anthem, the union’s grievance says\\xa0teams are operating outside of league rules, which do not require players to stand. “We believe these questions are improper, given League policy,” the NFLPA said in its statement. A spokesman for the Bengals declined to comment on the grievance. [Eric Reid charges NFL owners with collusion in grievance] In addition, the NFLPA filed a system arbitration case on behalf of all players, which aims\\xa0to stop clubs from asking any player whether he intends to protest during the national anthem. Reid had filed his own grievance Wednesday, charging owners with colluding to keep him out of the league. Reid has been among the most prominent players to protest by taking a knee during the national anthem. He’s said from the earliest days of free agency, which began in March, that teams won’t sign him because of his social activism, even though he’s said he’s willing to stand during the anthem next season. Both grievances are now subject to a confidential arbitration process under terms of the collective bargaining agreement between NFL owners and the players’ union. The NFLPA was not a formal party to Reid’s initial complaint, but has been supportive of the player’s decision, according to a person familiar with the situation, offering legal counsel and resources. “Our union supports Eric and we are considering other legal options to pursue,” a spokesman said in a statement last week. [NFL owners could leave national anthem policy to individual teams] Reid was the second player to charge the NFL owners with collusion over the anthem protests, and he’s using the same legal team as quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who remained unsigned all of last season. “Colin and Eric have taken courageous action at the expense of their professional careers and personal lives,” their attorneys, Mark Geragos and Ben Meiselas, said in a statement Monday. “They did these selfless acts because they wanted to shine light on inequity and oppression. Today they welcome all NFL Players who have joined in the prosecution of the NFL for their conspiracy and illegal acts. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the NFLPA in our fight for justice, equality and inalienable rights of all Americans.” Even without Kaepernick in the league, Reid continued the protests last year, repeatedly explaining that his protest targeted “systemic oppression.” Reid, 26, was a first-round draft pick by the San Francisco 49ers in 2013, made the Pro Bowl that year and has tallied 10 career interceptions in five seasons.

       "       'Perspective  Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events The vigor that newly installed Office of Personnel Management Director Jeff Pon has for civil service reform makes the Trump administration’s lack of enthusiasm for federal workplace diversity and inclusion all the more stark. “We want to be bold and aggressive, and we want to make sure that not only is it good for America but it’s also good for our civil service,” Pon said about civil service reform in a monologue to reporters Tuesday. It was a monologue because reporters were not allowed to ask questions during the conference call or follow up on the questions they submitted in advance, the bulk of which Pon didn’t answer. There’s nothing wrong with being a stenographer in a courtroom, but Pon’s refusal to take questions left journalists in the role of glorified dictation takers. Talk of overhauling the federal civil service has been around for decades, with outside experts offering well-considered studies and suggestions. No matter how needed aspects of reform might be, given the hiring freeze Trump implemented shortly after taking office, the pay freeze and compensation cuts the administration has proposed, and repeated Republican attempts to fire feds faster, federal employees can be excused if they view this administration’s push for civil service reform with trepidation. [Mulvaney defends pay freeze even for feds he knows are underpaid] Yet Pon is determined to have a proposal done by the midterm elections, an ambitious goal even if everyone agreed, which is hardly the case. Unfortunately, the passion he has for changing the way federal employees are managed — hired, compensated, promoted, fired and retired — far exceeds the administration’s diluted desire to have the workforce look like the public it serves. That was demonstrated by the two most recent OPM strategic plans — one from the Obama administration and the latest issued by the OPM in February, shortly before Pon took office. They could hardly differ more regarding diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce. The 2014-2018 Strategic Plan issued by the Obama administration makes diversity and inclusion a high priority. For example, the first of five strategic goals under the Obama plan is “attract and engage a diverse and effective OPM workforce.” The Trump plan for 2018-2022 scarcely mentions diversity and inclusion, providing only lip service. Look at the “Summary of Goals and Objectives” on Page 8 of the Trump document. It lists four goals with no mention of diversity and inclusion. In flow-chart fashion, the goals are supported by 14 objectives. None mentions diversity or inclusion. The words “diverse” or “diversity” are mentioned only four times in the 22-page document, compared with 20 times in the Obama administration’s 33 pages. “We find this strategy of omission alarming,” said Wanda V. Killingsworth, president of Federally Employed Women, “and hope that as positions are being filled in the federal government — particularly high-ranking offices — the Trump administration will place emphasis on diversity and inclusion.” While the administration’s retreat from diversity as a top priority can’t be pinned on Pon, he seems happy to represent an administration that gives diversity and inclusion advocates good reason to shudder. He did not respond to questions for this column, but in response to Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) during his October nomination hearing, Pon said he had not read Obama’s Executive Order 13583, “Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce.” In written responses submitted after the hearing, Pon told Harris that agencies “should actively recruit from all segments of society and provide broad leadership development opportunities to build their pipelines for future leaders” and promised “to build upon the goals identified” in Obama’s order. “It is my understanding, based on the last data OPM posted to its website, that minorities as a whole are no longer under-represented across the Federal workforce,” his written response said, “although their representation lags somewhat in SES positions.” “Somewhat” is an understatement for women, who are 35.3 percent of the Senior Executive Service. On the surface, it seems the data belie his understanding. The federal workforce was 8.4 percent Hispanic, according to the OPM’s Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program report for fiscal 2014, which was the document available in October. The fiscal 2016 report issued this February shows a slight increase, to 8.6 percent. In both fiscal years, the percentage of Hispanics in the civilian labor force was about 15 percent, making it seem that they are vastly underrepresented. On this point, however, Pon was not far off. The civilian labor force includes noncitizens. But citizenship is required for most federal jobs. Hispanic citizens are only about 10 percent of the civilian labor force, meaning their representation in the federal workforce is low, but not as low as it initially appears. Nonetheless, the lack of energy for diversity exhibited by the Trump administration worries proponents. “It is troubling that there appears to be a de-emphasis on diversity and inclusion under the Trump administration,” said Gilbert Sandate, chair of the Coalition for Fairness for Hispanics in Government, by email. “As the agency responsible for spearheading the federal government’s D&I policies and programs, it shows an absence of strong leadership and investment in this important area. We urge Director Pon to reevaluate OPM’s strategic direction regarding diversity and inclusion, or lack thereof, and amend this important policy document to ensure that D&I remains a strong component in the federal government’s toolbox.” Read more: Trump administration plans major overhaul of civil service system, but no specifics yet Latest federal diversity report from OPM shows little or no progress and some regression',\n",

Alfredo Ortiz, the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network, defends President Trump’s tax cut framework from critics who seek to discredit it by comparing the Republican federal tax cut effort to Kansas state’s 2012 tax cuts. The co-founder of home improvement giant Home Depot is warning the Republican Party to pass tax reform or face losing Congress in the 2018 elections. Evangelical Bishop Aubrey Shines, head pastor at Tampa, Florida’s Glory to Glory Church, is calling on Congress to pass pro-small business tax cuts. What is with all the fake news coming out of NBC News these days? I mean, above and beyond the fake news that has always been part and parcel of NBC’s leftwing bias. President Donald Trump announced the framework of his tax plan Wednesday afternoon, boasting that it would restore the American dream for working families. WASHINGTON, D.C. — Tea Party Patriots held a Capitol Hill rally on Saturday calling on legislators to keep the promises that they made to the American people on issues like repealing Obamacare, enforcing the border and immigration laws and cutting taxes. Congressman Dave Brat (R-VA) criticized Karl Rove for taking up what he called “fiction writing” in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal where the political strategist suggested the 30 uber-conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus would hold up a critical tax reform vote. Illegal aliens protected by an Obama-created temporary amnesty program are receiving job opportunities at a higher rate than unemployed Americans, a report by the Economist reveals. A potential plan by President Trump’s administration to trade amnesty for nearly 800,000 illegal aliens for tax cuts “is the ultimate bad deal-making,” Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach told Breitbart News exclusively Tuesday evening. The fate of Gary Cohn is a big topic at New York’s biggest Wall Street conference Tuesday. That’s hardly surprising. Top earners will not see their tax bill fall under the tax plan being worked out by Trump administration and lawmakers, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Tuesday. Donald Trump revealed more details of Republican plans to overhaul the U.S. tax system in a North Dakota speech Wednesday. President Donald Trump delivered a speech in North Dakota on Wednesday, urging Congress forward on tax reform. White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is reportedly upending traditional right/left divides on tax policy and pushing for a populist tax reform. Reportedly wants the top rate to have a 4 in front of the top rate. The conventional wisdom in the media, and even among many conservatives, is that President Donald Trump’s tweets are frustrating his policy agenda. But the opposite is true: his most controversial tweets are helping him. WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Tuesday evening, President Donald Trump will host a handful of Republican congressional leaders at the White House for a dinner centered around the President’s first trip abroad. He will also preside over\\xa0an afternoon bicameral Republican leadership The only parts of it that aren’t merely misleading are those riddled with errors and falsehoods. There is a simple reason Republicans lost the budget battle: they were willing to accept almost any deal, and Democrats knew it. President Donald Trump’s promises to cut taxes, increase infrastructure spending, and reduce regulatory burdens on businesses have boosted optimism of everyone from CEOs to small businesses to consumers, sent the financial markets soaring, and boosted job creation. President Donald Trump delivered a dynamic speech to a joint session of Congress, urging lawmakers and Americans to pursue an agenda focused on restoring the American dream, justice, and the rule of law. Tim Lee, senior vice president of Legal and Public Affairs for Center for Individual Freedom, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow broadcasting from CPAC on Thursday to discuss the Trump presidency, tax policy, and the Dakota Access Pipeline, among other topics. Veteran financial journalist John Carney made his debut appearance as a Breitbart News commentator on Thursday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily to discuss the historic rise of the Dow Jones average above 20,000 points. In an apparent attempt at winning back the hearts of conservative voters, the Republican representatives are making cuts in their proposed budget for next year. Those cuts include cutting Obamacare and IRS tax credits for the children of illegal aliens. Texas Governor Greg Abbott will make his ninth and last stop in Houston, Texas, on Tuesday as part of his statewide Grassroots Tour. The Governor will discuss the successes of the 2015 legislative session. The event is free. A new report released by the libertarian Cato Institute finds that among the eight governors who are GOP candidates for president, only Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana has cut spending in his state. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stated that on taxes he supports, simplifying the tax code and wants to “reduce taxes” on Tuesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” Although, he later added on CNN’s “New Day” that',\n",
       "       \"Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, said, “Consumers are always looking for a new low-cost health insurance option\\xa0but migration of healthy people to a new product will ultimately take a toll on what is presently being sold in the market.” AHPs are health insurance pools sponsored by an industry, trade, or professional association that provides health coverage to their members. President Trump signed an executive order in October that\\xa0expanded AHPs, as well as short-term limited-duration insurance plans to offer Americans more affordable options\\xa0compared to Obamacare. “This will cost the United States government virtually nothing and will provide people great, great health care,” Trump said in October. Avalere found that by 2022, one million Americans would move out of the Obamacare individual market to join AHPs, and 2.2 million people would drop out of the small-group market to join an AHP as well. The study also revealed that Americans would experience drastically lower health premiums through AHPs compared to Obamacare. AHPs would be roughly $2,900 lower per year compared to the small-group market and $9,700 lower per year compared to the individual market. Avalere cites that the lower average premiums in AHPs mostly result from a healthier insurance pool due to “risk selection,” and less generous offerings. Chris Sloan, senior manager at Avalere, explained, “The proposed rule would lead to millions of individuals and small businesses shifting into a new form of coverage, likely reducing their premiums, but leading to higher premiums in the markets they leave behind.” President Trump argued\\xa0last week that, “Piece by piece by piece, Obamacare is being wiped out!” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) praised the action last October as “the biggest free-market reform of health care in a generation.” Big Government, Obamacare, Congress, Donald Trump, obamacare, Rand Paul, Senate, White House Comment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.
